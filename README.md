Homework 2 for CS 3330.  

After cloning the files, one needs to run the Main.java to run the main program. 

Dependencies: Java 21 and its standard library, and the Student.java and StudentManager.java files. 

A .txt file is required within the files folder (under the ID_First Name_Last Name_Grade format per line) to be able to read student's information into, otherwise an exception occurs.

The project includes a Student Manager that holds Students(which have an associated name, ID, and grade) and can display the managed students, read in students from a .txt file, find students by their given ID, and update said students' grades by their given ID.
